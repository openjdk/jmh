        We can clearly see that "measureWrong" provides a very weird result: it "sorts" way too fast.
        "measureNeutral" is neither good or bad: while it prepares the data for each invocation correctly,
        the timing overheads are clearly visible. These overheads can be overwhelming, depending on
        the thread count and/or OS flavor.
