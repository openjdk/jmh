     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * Note the single token is just a few cycles, and the more tokens
     * you request, then more work is spent (almost linearly)
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_21 -w 1 -i 5 -f 1
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
