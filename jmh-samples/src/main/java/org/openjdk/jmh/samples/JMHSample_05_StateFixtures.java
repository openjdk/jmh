     * Since @State objects are kept around during the lifetime of the
     * benchmark, it helps to have the methods which do state housekeeping.
     * These are usual fixture methods, you are probably familiar with them from
     * JUnit and TestNG.
     *
     * Fixture methods make sense only on @State objects, and JMH will fail to
     * compile the test otherwise.
     *
     * As with the State, fixture methods are only called by those benchmark
     * threads which are using the state. That means you can operate in the
     * thread-local context, and (not) use synchronization as if you are
     * executing in the context of benchmark thread.
     *
     * Note: fixture methods can also work with static fields, although the
     * semantics of these operations fall back out of State scope, and obey
     * usual Java rules (i.e. one static field per class).

     *
     * You can see measureRight() yields the result, and measureWrong() fires
     * the assert at the end of the run.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ ./mvnw clean install
     *    $ java -ea -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_05 -f 1
     *    (we requested single fork; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
