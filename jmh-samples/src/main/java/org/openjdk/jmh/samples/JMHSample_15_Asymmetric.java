     * So far all the tests were symmetric: the same code was executed in all the threads.
     * At times, you need the asymmetric test. JMH provides this with the notion of @Group,
     * which can bind several methods together, and all the threads are distributed among
     * the test methods.
     *
     * Each execution group contains of two or more threads. If more threads are requested
     * to be run via the command line option, then more execution groups are created.
     * JMH will always round up the actual thread count to the execution group size, this
     * will only allow the full execution groups.
     *
     * Note that two state scopes: Scope.Benchmark and Scope.Thread are not covering all
     * the use cases here -- you either share everything in the state, or share nothing.
     * To break this, we have the middle ground Scope.Group, which marks the state to be
     * shared within the execution group, but not among the groups.
     *
     * Putting this all together, if we want to run this with 8 threads, the example below
     * means:
     *  a) make two execution groups, each having 4 threads (by default)
     *  b) each execution group has one benchmark instance to share (= share the $counter)
     *  c) each execution group has 3 thread executing inc().
     *  d) each execution group has 1 thread executing get().

     * You will have the distinct metrics for inc() and get() from this run.

     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/microbenchmarks.jar ".*JMHSample_15.*" -wi 5 -i 5 -f 1
     *    (we requested 5 warmup/measurement iterations, single fork)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
