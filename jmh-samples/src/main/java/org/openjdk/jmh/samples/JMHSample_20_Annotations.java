     *
     * Note JMH honors the default annotation settings. You can always override
     * the defaults via the command line or API.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ ./mvnw clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_20
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
