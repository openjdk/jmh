     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * Note the performance of the baseline, blank, and inline methods are the same.
     * dontinline differs a bit, because we are making the proper call.
     * exclude is severely slower, becase we are not compiling it at all.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_16 -wi 1 -i 3 -f 1
     *    (we requested 1 warmup iterations, 3 iterations, single fork)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
