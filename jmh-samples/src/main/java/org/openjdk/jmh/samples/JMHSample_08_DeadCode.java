     *

     * where appropriate: returning the result of the computation will ask JMH
     * to deal with the result to limit dead-code elimination (returned results
     * are implicitly consumed by Blackholes, see JMHSample_09_Blackholes).

     *
     * You can see the unrealistically fast calculation in with measureWrong(),
     * while realistic measurement with measureRight().
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_08 -f 1
     *    (we requested single fork; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
