     *
     * You can see the benchmark runs as usual.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_04 -wi 5 -i 5 -f 1
     *    (we requested 5 warmup/measurement iterations, single fork)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
