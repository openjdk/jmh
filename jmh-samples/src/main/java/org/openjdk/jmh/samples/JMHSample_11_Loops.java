     * the method call. Don't buy this argument; you will see there is more

     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * You might notice the larger the repetitions count, the lower the "perceived"
     * cost of the operation being measured. Up to the point we do each addition with 1/20 ns,
     * well beyond what hardware can actually do.
     *
     * This happens because the loop is heavily unrolled/pipelined, and the operation
     * to be measured is hoisted from the loop. Morale: don't overuse loops, rely on JMH
     * to get the measurement right.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_11 -wi 5 -i 5 -f 1
     *    (we requested 5 warmup/measurement iterations, single fork)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
