     * annotation, or select/override the mode via the runtime options.
     *
     * With this scenario, we start to measure something useful. Note that our
     * payload code potentially throws exceptions, and we can just declare them
     * to be thrown. If the code throws the actual exception, the benchmark
     * execution will stop with an error.

     * look into the generated code. You might see the code is doing not

     * You are expected to see the different run modes for the same benchmark.
     * Note the units are different, scores are consistent with each other.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ ./mvnw clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_02 -f 1
     *    (we requested a single fork; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
