     * In this example, we want to measure the simple performance characteristics
     * of the ArrayBlockingQueue. Unfortunately, doing that without a harness
     * support will deadlock one of the threads, because the executions of
     * take/put are not paired perfectly. Fortunately for us, both methods react
     * to interrupts well, and therefore we can rely on JMH to terminate the
     * measurement for us. JMH will notify users about the interrupt actions
     * nevertheless, so users can see if those interrupts affected the measurement.
     * JMH will start issuing interrupts after the default or user-specified timeout
     * had been reached.
     *
     * This is a variant of org.openjdk.jmh.samples.JMHSample_18_Control, but without
     * the explicit control objects. This example is suitable for the methods which
     * react to interrupts gracefully.

     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ ./mvnw clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_30 -t 2 -f 5 -to 10
     *    (we requested 2 threads, 5 forks, and 10 sec timeout)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
