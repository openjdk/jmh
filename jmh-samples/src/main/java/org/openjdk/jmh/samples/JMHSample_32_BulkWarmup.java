     * This is an addendum to JMHSample_12_Forking test.
     *
     * Sometimes you want an opposite configuration: instead of separating the profiles
     * for different benchmarks, you want to mix them together to test the worst-case
     * scenario.
     *
     * JMH has a bulk warmup feature for that: it does the warmups for all the tests
     * first, and then measures them. JMH still forks the JVM for each test, but once the
     * new JVM has started, all the warmups are being run there, before running the
     * measurement. This helps to dodge the type profile skews, as each test is still
     * executed in a different JVM, and we only "mix" the warmup code we want.

     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * Note how JMH runs the warmups first, and only then a given test. Note how JMH re-warmups
     * the JVM for each test. The scores for C1 and C2 cases are equally bad, compare them to
     * the scores from JMHSample_12_Forking.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ ./mvnw clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_32 -f 1 -wm BULK
     *    (we requested a single fork, and bulk warmup mode; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
