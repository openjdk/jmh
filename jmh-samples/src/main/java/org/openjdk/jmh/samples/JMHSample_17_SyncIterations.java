     * It turns out if you run the benchmark with multiple threads,

     * performance.
     *
     * The natural way would be to park all the threads on some sort
     * of barrier, and the let them go "at once". However, that does
     * not work: there are no guarantees the worker threads will start
     * at the same time, meaning other worker threads are working
     * in better conditions, skewing the result.
     *
     * The better solution would be to introduce bogus iterations,
     * ramp up the threads executing the iterations, and then atomically
     * shift the system to measuring stuff. The same thing can be done
     * during the rampdown. This sounds complicated, but JMH already
     * handles that for you.

     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * You will need to oversubscribe the system to make this effect
     * clearly visible; however, this effect can also be shown on the
     * unsaturated systems.*
     *
     * Note the performance of -si false version is more flaky, even
     * though it is "better". This is the false improvement, granted by
     * some of the threads executing in solo. The -si true version more stable
     * and coherent.
     *
     * -si true is enabled by default.
     *
     * Say, $CPU is the number of CPUs on your machine.
     *
     * You can run this test with:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ ./mvnw clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_17 \
     *        -w 1s -r 1s -f 1 -t ${CPU*16} -si {true|false}
     *    (we requested shorter warmup/measurement iterations, single fork,
     *     lots of threads, and changeable "synchronize iterations" option)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
