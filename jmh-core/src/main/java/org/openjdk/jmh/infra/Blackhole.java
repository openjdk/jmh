    /*
     * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
     *
     * The major things to dodge with Blackholes are:
     *
     *   a) Dead-code elimination: the arguments should be used on every call,
     *      so that compilers are unable to fold them into constants or
     *      otherwise optimize them away along with the computations resulted
     *      in them.
     *
     *   b) False sharing: reading/writing the state may disturb the cache
     *      lines. We need to isolate the critical fields to achieve tolerable
     *      performance.
     *
     *   c) Write wall: we need to ease off on writes as much as possible,
     *      since it disturbs the caches, pollutes the write buffers, etc.
     *      This may very well result in hitting the memory wall prematurely.
     *      Reading memory is fine as long as it is cacheable.
     *
     * To achieve these goals, we are piggybacking on several things in the
     * compilers:
     *
     *  1. Superclass fields are not reordered with the subclass' fields.
     *     No practical VM that we are aware of is doing this. It is unpractical,
     *     because if the superclass fields are at the different offsets in two
     *     subclasses, the VMs would then need to do the polymorphic access for
     *     the superclass fields.
     *
     *  2. Compilers are unable to predict the value of the volatile read.
     *     While the compilers can speculatively optimize until the relevant
     *     volatile write happens, it is unlikely to be practical to be able to stop
     *     all the threads the instant that write had happened.
     *
     *  3. Compilers' code motion usually respects data dependencies, and they would
     *     not normally schedule the consumer block before the code that generated
     *     a value.
     *
     *  4. Compilers are not doing aggressive inter-procedural optimizations,
     *     and/or break them when the target method is forced to be non-inlineable.
     *
     * Observation (1) allows us to "squash" the protected fields in the inheritance
     * hierarchy so that the padding in super- and sub-class are laid out right before
     * and right after the protected fields. We also pad with booleans so that dense
     * layout in superclass does not have the gap where runtime can fit the subclass field.
     *
     * Observation (2) allows us to compare the incoming primitive values against
     * the relevant volatile-guarded fields. The values in those guarded fields are
     * never changing, but due to (2), we should re-read the values again and again.
     * Also, observation (3) requires us to to use the incoming value in the computation,
     * thus anchoring the Blackhole code after the generating expression.
     *
     * Primitives are a bit hard, because we can't predict what values we
     * will be fed. But we can compare the incoming value with *two* distinct
     * known values, and both checks will never be true at the same time.
     * Note the bitwise AND in all the predicates: both to spare additional
     * branch, and also to provide more uniformity in the performance. Where possible,
     * we are using a specific code shape to force generating a single branch, e.g.
     * making compiler to evaluate the predicate in full, not speculate on components.
     *
     * Objects should normally abide the Java's referential semantics, i.e. the
     * incoming objects will never be equal to the distinct object we have, and
     * volatile read will break the speculation about what we compare with.
     * However, smart compilers may deduce that the distinct non-escaped object
     * on the other side is not equal to anything we have, and fold the comparison
     * to "false". We do inlined thread-local random to get those objects escaped
     * with infinitesimal probability. Then again, smart compilers may skip from
     * generating the slow path, and apply the previous logic to constant-fold
     * the condition to "false". We are warming up the slow-path in the beginning
     * to evade that effect. Some caution needs to be exercised not to retain the
     * captured objects forever: this is normally achieved by calling evaporate()
     * regularly, but we also additionally protect with retaining the object on
     * weak reference (contrary to phantom-ref, publishing object still has to
     * happen, because reference users might need to discover the object).
     *
     * Observation (4) provides us with an opportunity to create a safety net in case
     * either (1), (2) or (3) fails. This is why Blackhole methods are prohibited from
     * being inlined. This is treated specially in JMH runner code (see CompilerHints).
     * Conversely, both (1), (2), (3) are covering in case (4) fails. This provides
     * a defense in depth for Blackhole implementation, where a point failure is a
     * performance nuisance, but not a correctness catastrophe.
     *
     * In all cases, consumes do the volatile reads to have a consistent memory
     * semantics across all consume methods.
     *
     * There is an experimental compiler support for Blackholes that instructs compilers
     * to treat specific methods as blackholes: keeping their arguments alive. At some
     * point in the future, we hope to switch to that mode by default, thus greatly
     * simplifying the Blackhole code.
     *
     * An utmost caution should be exercised when changing the Blackhole code. Nominally,
     * the JMH Core Benchmarks should be run on multiple platforms (and their generated code
     * examined) to check the effects are still in place, and the overheads are not prohibitive.
     * Or, in other words:
     *
     * IMPLEMENTING AN EFFICIENT / CORRECT BLACKHOLE IS NOT A SIMPLE TASK YOU CAN
     * DO OVERNIGHT. IT REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT JVM/COMPILER/PERFORMANCE EXPERTISE,
     * AND LOTS OF TIME OVER THAT. ADJUST YOUR PLANS ACCORDINGLY.
